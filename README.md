# uniiku-Arweave
***Migrating uniiku to the permaweb***

We are working to gauge the arweave ecosystem, its pros and cons related to integrating arweave within uniiku tags. So far, arweave looks great:

**Pros**
- Pay once / store forever. No more ongoing AWS costs.
- Permanent storage fits our value proposition.
- Engaged and vibrant community
- JS

**Cons**
- Young tech / ecosystem (many things still beta / underproved / buggy)
- We need to take a leap of faith on the future of arweave

As uniiku is also a new / unproved product, it seems fit to go ahead and share the risk.
